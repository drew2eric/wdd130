        This site is a place for me to display and sell my crochet creations. I will also start selling crochet patterns on the site sometime soon!
        To start crocheting, you need some sort of yarn and a crochet hook. Yarn and crochet hooks have different sizes and textures, best used for specific projects. For my stuffed animals, I use a chunky chenille yarn with a size 8mm crochet hook. This yarn seems to be the softest and coziest for the stuffed animals I want to make. To stuff the animals, I use regular polyester fiber fill that you kind find at any craft store. The eyes and accessories on my animals were all purchased online.

      <h3>Stuffed Animals</h3>
      <p>
        These axolotls are my absolute favorite to make! They are so adorable and only take me a couple of hours to create. They come in endless color variations, which makes them so much more fun and unique. Their pattern was designed and made by me. 
        This bunny is perfect for cuddling. The arms and ears are very floppy and swing around a lot as you hold it, which makes it fun to play with and pose. This pattern was created by me, and took a few different tries to come up with this final version.
        This shark was one of my most difficult to make! It has so many different parts which make it complicated but fun. The gills are my very favorite part of this stuffed animal!

      <h3>Crochet Accessories</h3>
      <p>
        These sleeves were one of the first things I made when I learned to crochet a few years ago. They are fun to pair with almost every outfit, and are nice and airy so there is no fear of overheating! 
        This net can be used to hold so many different things, but I love to store my crochet creations in it. It is perfect to hang stuffed animals in the corner of your bedroom! It is really stretchy which allows it to hold a lot more than you may think.
