        This site is a place for me to display and sell my crochet creations. I will also start selling crochet patterns on the site sometime soon! 
        To start crocheting, you need some sort of yarn and a crochet hook. Yarn and crochet hooks have different sizes and textures, best used for specific projects. For my stuffed animals, I use a chunky chenille yarn with a size 8mm crochet hook. This yarn seems to be the softest and coziest for the stuffed animals I want to make. To stuff the animals, I use regular polyester fiber fill that you kind find at any craft store. The eyes and accessories on my animals were all purchased online. 
      
        About me: Hello! My name is Drew! I started crocheting in the fall of 2023, and have been addicted ever since. I started by making items of clothing like sweaters, scarves, and headbands, then eventually transitioned into making stuffed animals. I have made dozens of stuffed animals for my friends and family, and am excited to start selling them here in my shop!

      <h3>Stuffed Animals</h3>
      <p>
        All of the following Items are for sale! If interested in purchasing an item or if you have any questions, please contact me at (my email address) or (my phone number)!

        These axolotls are my absolute favorite to make! They are so adorable and only take me a couple of hours to create. They come in endless color variations, which makes them so much more fun and unique. Their pattern was designed and made by me. 
        
        This bunny is perfect for cuddling. The arms and ears are very floppy and swing around a lot as you hold it, which makes it fun to play with and pose. This pattern was created by me, and took a few different tries to come up with this final version.
        
        This shark was one of my most difficult to make! It has so many different parts which make it complicated but fun. The gills are my very favorite part of this stuffed animal! Minimal sewing was involved. 
        
        This dinosaur is the first stuffed animal I crochet! It is much bigger than my other animals, with a height of 1.5 feet, and a length of 1.75 feet. It is perfect to use as a pillow or even an arm rest when reading a book!
        
        This flamingo has a fun mix of different textured and colored yarns! The legs are very flimsy and dangle as you hold it, which definitely adds to its cute character. This pattern was designed and made by me
        
        This giraffe is one of my absolute favorite creations. It was a challenge to create the spots on the body, but it turned out to be so much cuter than expected! This pattern was designed and made by me. 
        
        These octopi are really adorable desk decorations! They are perfect for birthday gifts or even as stocking stuffers. They come in every color imaginable, and take less than 15 minutes to make!

      <h3>Crochet Accessories</h3>
      <p>
        All of the following Items are for sale! If interested in purchasing an item or if you have any questions, please contact me at (my email address) or (my phone number)!

        These sleeves were one of the first things I made when I learned to crochet about a year ago. They are fun to pair with almost every outfit, and are nice and airy so there is no fear of overheating! 
        
        This net can be used to hold so many different things, but I love to store my crochet creations in it. It is perfect to hang stuffed animals in the corner of your bedroom! It is really stretchy which allows it to hold a lot more than you may think.
