    <h2>Drew Erickson</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Drew and I am from Portland, Oregon. I am a junior, and my major is currently undecided. I am a transfer student from the University of Arizona, so this is my first semester at BYUI!</p>
    <p>I love to play a bunch of different sports, but my two favorites are tennis and basketball. I also love watching college football and basketball. I just recently learned how to crochet, and spend a lot of my free time crocheting and watching movies!</p>
